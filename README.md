> ***RoboTransfer***, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits and object swaps.

## ✅ Setup Environment

We use uv to manage dependencies, to get our environments:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/RoboTransfer.git
cd RoboTransfer
export UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=600
uv sync
uv pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Inference

```bash
uv run main.py # --mem_efficient for 4090
```


## 📈 More Inference Data

Update the dependencies of the data pipeline.
```bash
uv sync --extra data
```

### ⚙️ For more sim data

You can obtain more simulation data from the [RoboTwin CVPR Challenge](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin/tree/CVPR-Challenge-2025-Round1).
 <!-- Alternatively, you can use the collected data in [RoboTwin2.0-aloha-agilex](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TianxingChen/RoboTwin2.0/tree/main/dataset/aloha-agilex). -->
You can then use the process_sim.sh script to convert raw data (.pickle files and .hdf5) into the RoboTransfer format with geometric conditioning.

```bash
script/process_sim.sh
```

### 🤖 For more real data
For real-world data collected by the ALOHA-AgileX robot system, access the dataset [RoboTransfer-RealData](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HorizonRobotics/RoboTransfer-RealData). You can then process raw RGB images using the process_real.sh script to convert them into RoboTransfer format with geometric conditioning.

```bash
script/process_real.sh
```
